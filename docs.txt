Implementation Notes
  Responsive Design: The layout uses flexbox and grid with media queries to ensure perfect display on all devices.

  Animations: All elements have subtle animations on hover, scroll, and state changes using CSS transitions and keyframes.

  Theme System: The dark/light theme is implemented with CSS variables and localStorage persistence.

  Simulated Backend: The auth.js file simulates user authentication and data persistence using localStorage.

  Security Focus: The design incorporates cybersecurity elements like encryption badges, blockchain visualization, and security education.

  Performance: Assets are optimized, and the loading overlay ensures a smooth initial experience.

  Accessibility: Proper ARIA labels, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation support.
